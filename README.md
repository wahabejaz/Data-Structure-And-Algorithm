# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++
Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository!  
This repo contains my solutions to classic problems written in **C++**, organized by topic.

**Goal:** Strengthen problem-solving skills, prepare for coding interviews, and reinforce C++ logic through practice.

---

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stack & Queue
- Recursion
- Searching & Sorting
- Hashing
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy, Sliding Window, Backtracking, etc.

Each topic contains `.cpp` files with:
- Problem name and approach (in comments)
- Code with inline explanation
- Time and space complexity

---

## Language Used
- **C++** (with STL where appropriate)

---

## My Learning Strategy
- Solve at least one DSA problem per day
- Focus on patterns (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer)
- Improve time-space complexity analysis
- Track progress by updating this repo regularly
